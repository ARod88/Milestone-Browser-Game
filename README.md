How am I going to generate the words?  

Define an array of words. Then create a variable that will select a random word and multiple it by the length of the word.  

Using if statements and functions.  

Use if statements , if correct letter is clicked then display the correct button and if wrong let image appear.  Create function that when a button is clicked it will grab the images and make them disappear or appear. I also need to make sure the buttons are hidden and will add an event listener to click on the letter that will be sent to the empty underscores. 

Create a variable counter and initialized it to 0. Whenever the user makes an incorrect guess, the updateCounter() function is called, which add the counter variable by 1  

Then I will set a variable maxGuesses to 6, which represents the maximum number of incorrect guesses allowed in the game. If the user reaches this limit, the endGame() function can be called to end the game. 

 

Buttons  

Create variables guessInput( A-Z). These buttons will be the selections for the user to click when they are guessing the word.  

 

Create variable that will indicate results that will determine win or lose.
